## Web Scraping from Static Website using Python.

Basically, Web Scraping is an efficient and fast method of extracting enormous public data from websites.It saves us from the trouble of manually downloading or copying any data from a website and automates the whole process.We extract data from the front-end of the website then parse the html data and extract tidy data from it to transform data into required format.Then store it in doc/pdf/csv format of your choice.

Web Scraping has a huge application in E-commerce,Telecommunication,Fintech and IT industries.

Well,it's a legal task when you are following proper guidelines and extracting only public data.

Step 1: Import necessary libraries into your Coding environment or Notebook(preferable) like BeautifulSoup,requests,Pandas,csv,etc.


Step 2: Find url of the website that you want to extrat the data from.(Example :- cricbuzz.com,flipkart.com,amazon.com,etc)

Step 3: Inspect the page you need to specify the content variable from html which you want to extract.Keyboard shortcut to inspect - (Ctrl+Shift+i)/Right click and select inspect from dropdown menu.

Step 4:  Write python code for scraping.
